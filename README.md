Project name: parkinsons-updrs-regression
Description: Regression project predicting total_UPDRS from voice features using PyCaret.

##Abstract: This project investigates the application of machine learning regression techniques in order to predict total_UPDRS which is an important clinical measure that is used to assess the severity and progression of Parkinsons disease. By using the Parkinson’s telemonitoring dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository many regression algorithms were trained and evaluated following a PyCaret workflow. After comparing all the models, the Extra Trees Regressor was shown to be the best performing algorithm achieving strong predictive accuracy with a MAE of 1.01, an RMSE of 1.78 and an R² of 0.97. Additional evaluation on the holdout set confirmed the reliability of the algorithm producing an MAE of 0.95, RMSE of 1.69, and R² = 0.98. These results demonstrate that tree-based methods particularly Extra Trees Regressor are incredibly effective for modeling complex biomedical data and signals to provide clinically useful predictions of the severity of Parkinson’s disease in a Patient.
